# slo-hiker

The goal of this project was to build an application that provides information about hiking trails in the San Luis Obispo area and can help users decide what trail is right for them. It was built using AngularJS to take advantage of the efficiency of utilizing templates for the individual trail information.

The site has the following functionality:

* Displays trails available in San Luis Obispo
* Ability to sort the trails by length, time and difficulty
* View the locations of the trailheads on a map
* See the current temperature and five day forecast
* Link from the home page to more details about the individual trails
* Display detailed information about the individual trails
* Get directions to the trailhead from the individual trail page
